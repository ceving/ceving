* Thoughts
  This file contains some random thoughts, which came up during development.

  - It is not possible to implement a state as a process in a pipe. If
    the sender fails, the state wil be empty instead of erronous.
    
    Example: kill(getpid(), SIGKILL) | state
    
    The input handle of state will just be closed.  It is not possible
    to distinguish the error this from the situation, where the sender
    did not send anything.

    The state must only be written, if the sender succeeds.
